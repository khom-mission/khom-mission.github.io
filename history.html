  sections:
  - text: Christian faith was preached in Britain for the first time in the blessed
      shores of Kent by St. Augustine the Benedictine monk, commissioned by Pope Gregory
      the Great. This “Apostle to the English” became the first Archbishop of Canterbury
      in 597 AD.  St. Augustine of Canterbury was a Benedictine monk who became the
      first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597. He is considered the “Apostle
      to the English” and a founder of the English Church.
  - text: At St Augustine’s Abbey, hundreds of pious have worshipped – since AD 597,
      making it one of Britain’s oldest monastic sites. In the late sixth century,
      Pope Gregory I dispatched a small group of monks led by St Augustine to bring
      back Christianity to southern England. King Ethelbert of Kent was easily converted
      and donated land to set up a monastery. Some 940 years of monastic life, scattering
      of treasures, a redesign by Augustus Welby Pugin and much restoration later,
      renewed activity has come back in 2014.
  - text: 'In God’s Providence, St. Augustine’s Abbey was transformed into Divine Retreat Centre UK in 2014. Divine UK is a Charismatic Catholic ministry is part of the renewal movement of the Vincentian Congregation of India, based on the spiritual traditions bequeathed by St. Vincent de Paul.'
  - text: 'The Divine Retreat Centre – St Augustines Abbey, UK (DRC UK), belonging to the Vincentian Congregation (VC), is the first retreat centre of the Divine-Potta ministry in Europe. The centre aims to reach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to every individual, religion, denomination, nationality, family and community. Based on the Bible and the catechism of the Catholic church, three-day retreats are held at the centre, which include talks, Holy Mass, Eucharistic adoration, healing services, confessions, praise and anointed worship.'
  - text: 'Nestled in a scenic corner of the Canterbury shore, it houses two priests full time and holds retreats every month. Divine Retreat Centre aim to become yet another channel through which Christ’s endless love is preached and exhibited in daily life; a home where spirituality enables a genuine encounter with Christ and real transformation. “It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing” (Is 35:2)'
