- title: Making disciples who make disciples
  sections:
  - text: 2000 years ago, Jesus looked at a group of young people, loved them and
      challenged them, ''Come, Follow Me''. And empowered by the Holy Spirit, all
      of them went on to turn the world of their day upside down. This same challenge
      is posed to you today by the same Jesus.
  - text: 'For 10 weeks, we will rediscover and pursue Jesus radically through teaching,
      prayer, scripture and one on one accompaniment. We will cover topics like: intimacy
      with God, living by the Spirit, reshaping our worldview and many more. With
      a lifestyle of discipleship at the core of this school, we aim to transition
      our worldly perspective to Kingdom perspective.'
  - text: If you're stuck at a crossroad, this school is made for you! God's plan
      for you was never meant to be mediocre. Be a disciple. Make disciples.
