  sections:
  - text: "2000 years ago, Jesus looked at a group of young people, loved them and challenged them, ''Come, Follow Me''. And empowered by the Holy Spirit, all of them went on to turn the world of their day upside down. This same challenge is posed to you today by the same Jesus." 
  - text: "For 10 weeks, we will rediscover and pursue Jesus radically through teaching, prayer, scripture and one on one accompaniment. We will cover topics like: intimacy with God, living by the Spirit, reshaping our worldview and many more. With a lifestyle of discipleship at the core of this school, we aim to transition our worldly perspective to Kingdom perspective."
  - text: "If you're stuck at a crossroad, this school is made for you! God's plan for you was never meant to be mediocre. Be a disciple. Make disciples."
