- title: Making disciples who make disciples
  sections:
  - text: "2000 years ago, Jesus looked at a group of young people, loved them and challenged them, ''Come, Follow Me''. And empowered by the Holy Spirit, all of them went on to turn the world of their day upside down. This same challenge is posed to you today by the same Jesus." 
  - text: "For 10 weeks, we will rediscover and pursue Jesus radically through teaching, prayer, scripture and one on one accompaniment. We will cover topics like: intimacy with God, living by the Spirit, reshaping our worldview and many more. With a lifestyle of discipleship at the core of this school, we aim to transition our worldly perspective to Kingdom perspective."
  - text: "If you're stuck at a crossroad, this school is made for you! God's plan for you was never meant to be mediocre. Be a disciple. Make disciples."

  testimony: Words in the Bible are alive again to me. I speak and listen to God!
    I have new hope and am happy to discover each day what God prepared for me, His
    plan for my life! I love the structure of this school - it is very personal. My
    questions are answered and I am encouraged after each meeting. God is networking
    people from all around the world. It is such a blessing to see this and be a part
    of it.

  testimony: CROSSROAD came at the perfect time in my life as a confirmation that
    God’s calling for me is bigger than I once imagined, especially after being in
    ministry for about 8 years. God has been working through this school in mighty
    ways in my life especially in convicting me in areas of my life that I’ve been
    avoiding. Through CROSSROAD, God has also been equipping me with the courage to
    radically live and serve Him, no matter what it takes.

  testimony: 'After starting CROSSROAD, I unexpectedly found myself in a time of wilderness
    and at a crossroad of inner conflicts: "Do I trust myself or do I trust Jesus?
    Do I love Him or myself? Do I want to live the life my own way or do I want to
    live it His way? Am I ready to lay down my rights of unfulfilled dreams and desires
    before God, or am I going to postpone my following of Jesus until those desires
    are filled? And really - Do I follow Jesus because of the benefits or because
    I really love Him?" God surrounded me with amazing and encouraging people that
    share my faith and I feel so much at home amongst them. Alicia and Lavinia have
    put up a great challenge in the midst of my busy working life to dig deeper into
    God''s heart for my life.'

  testimony: CROSSROAD made me realise that my emotions were still getting the better
    of me and that I have not dealt with the root of it for a really long time. But
    I was able to surrender it all to God and felt a burden lift off my chest and
    an immense relief and joy that I couldn't put into words.

  testimony: The one on one sessions with Lavinia has spiritually and devoutly impacted
    my life. I was practically taught how to hear from God. It was an awesome encounter.
    Since then, I have learnt to engage in this kingdom mystery.

  testimony: Previously, I had fear of men but during CROSSROAD, through an encounter
    with the Word of God, I no longer fear men.

  testimony: At first, I thought CROSSROAD was just like another bible study so I
    didn't expect much besides maybe a deeper knowledge of the Bible. But a miracle
    happened. Through CROSSROAD, God revealed to me that my self-image was not completely
    restored (I thought I was fully healed) and this is such a breakthrough for me
    because this had been holding me back for so long from doing things boldly for
    Him.

  testimony: Getting to join a group led by others my age as well as people from all
    over the world has been fulfilling. I’ve always been reluctant to evangelize but
    CROSSROAD has provided me the skills and confidence to proudly proclaim the Word
    of God to others. The moments alone with God are a level of intimacy with Him
    that I haven’t reached for a long time, and I’m grateful to CROSSROAD for starting
    me back on that journey.

  testimony: Joining CROSSROAD was one of the best decisions I’ve made since it really
    changed my life in a very positive way. Before, I felt that my life was so boring
    and stressful but now I really feel that my life is full of excitement. I also
    have a more intimate relationship with God and feel His love for me.
- name: Gracianne, Malaysia

  testimony: I have always heard about the joy of living in Jesus. I’ve heard priests
    and nuns talk about it. I thought I needed to work very hard in my faith to get
    there but just spending time in prayer and through CROSSROAD, I feel that absolute
    happiness. I’m much happier nowadays that I could scream it off the mountain top.
    I’ve always wanted to control my life and depend on my own efforts but I started
    to let God take control and it is the best thing I’ve done!

  testimony: Since we began the school, my prayer life has been revived as well as
    my reading of the Bible has improved tremendously. There are people whom I had
    not forgiven - I forgave them during this period. I give God all the glory.”
- name: Martina, Croatia

  testimony: Before this school started, I was praying for God to give me some program
    or something where my faith can grow, and God gave me CROSSROAD, that is such
    a blessing to me. God has done so many great things. I felt like God had set me
    free, and I feel so free, so happy, too good. My eyes are shining.
- name: Jaish, Pakistan

  testimony: I used to question why I can't hear God's voice. I tried so much but
    still I couldn't hear anything from Him. But after all the sessions and especially
    the one on one conversations with Alicia - I encountered the Holy Spirit. Now
    I say this loudly and declare to everyone that YES! I can hear God's voice in
    my personal prayer and He wants to use me for His mission.
- name: Sharon, Malaysia

  testimony: Through CROSSROAD, God showed me why He's breaking me in order for Him
    to shape me into the person He wants me to be. I've learnt to always rest in Him,
    in the midst of the busyness of the world, I started to realize how my soul longs
    for God and how precious the quiet moments with Christ are. I found strength and
    confidence to always say yes to God and I can feel that God is really working
    in my life.
- name: Antony, India

  testimony: Before CROSSROAD, I was having a relationship with God which was law-based
    with regard to trying to follow His commandments. But now it is out of love towards
    God that I want to keep His commandments.
